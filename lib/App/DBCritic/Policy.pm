=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package App::DBCritic::Policy::MyPolicy;
    use Moo;

    has description => ( default => sub{'Follow my policy'} );
    has explanation => ( default => {'My way or the highway'} );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a L<role|Moo::Role> consumed by all L<App::DBCritic|App::DBCritic>
policy plugins.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 element

Read-only accessor for the current schema element being examined by
L<App::DBCritic|App::DBCritic>.

=head2 schema

Read-only accessor for the current schema object being examined by
L<App::DBCritic|App::DBCritic>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 violation

Given a string description of a violation that has been encountered, creates a
new L<App::DBCritic::Violation|App::DBCritic::Violation>
object from the current policy.

=head2 description

Required method. Returns a short string describing what's wrong.

=head2 explanation

Required method. Returns a string giving further details.

=head2 applies_to

Required method. Returns an array reference of types of
L<DBIx::Class|DBIx::Class> objects
indicating what part(s) of the schema the policy is interested in.

=head2 violates

Required method. Role consumers must implement a C<violates> method that
returns true if the
policy is violated and false otherwise, based on attributes provided by the
role.  Callers should call the C<violates> method as the following:

    $policy->violates($element, $schema);
