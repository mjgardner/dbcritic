=head1 NAME

App::DBCritic - Critique a database schema for best practices

=head1 VERSION

version 0.021

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use App::DBCritic;

    my $critic = App::DBCritic->new(
        dsn => 'dbi:Oracle:HR', username => 'scott', password => 'tiger');
    $critic->critique();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package is used to scan a database schema and catalog any violations
of best practices as defined by a set of policy plugins.  It takes conceptual
and API inspiration from L<Perl::Critic|Perl::Critic>.

B<dbcritic> is the command line interface.

This is a work in progress - please see the L</SUPPORT> section below for
information on how to contribute.  It especially needs ideas (and
implementations!) of new policies!

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 class_name

The name of a L<DBIx::Class::Schema|DBIx::Class::Schema> class you wish to
L</critique>.
Only settable at construction time.

=head2 schema

A L<DBIx::Class::Schema|DBIx::Class::Schema> object you wish to L</critique>.
Only settable at construction time.

=head2 dsn

=head2 username

=head2 password

The L<DBI|DBI> data source name (required) and optional username and password
used to connect to the database.  If no L</class_name> or L</schema> is
provided, L<DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader|DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader> will then
construct schema classes dynamically to be critiqued.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 policies

Returns an array of loaded policy names that will be applied during
L</critique>.  By default all modules under the
C<App::DBCritic::Policy> namespace are loaded.

=head2 critique

Runs the L</schema> through the C<App::DBCritic> engine using all
the policies that have been loaded and dumps a string representation of
L</violations> to C<STDOUT>.

=head2 violations

Returns an array reference of all
L<App::DBCritic::Violation|App::DBCritic::Violation>s
picked up by the various policies.
